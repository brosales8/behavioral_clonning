# Behavioral Cloning
### Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree

**Author:** Bryan Rosales
**Date:** July 30th, 2017


Overview
---

The general scope of the project is to train a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to clone the behavior of driving a vehicle. So, using the Udacity simulator, it is possible to generate data images that are used later for training the network.

The project uses Udacity simulator in 2 ways: 
1) Drive-mode, where the user can drive the vehicle and collect data (as a secuence of images) to be used to train a CNN later.<br>
2) Auto-mode, once the model is ready, this option allows to test the performance of the model on the road.

The simulator is intellectual property of Udacity.
